# Project Idea

Our idea is to create a unified platform to achieve various tasks in disaster management, prevention and recovery. 
We are planning to incorporate helpful mitigation features alongisde Machine Learning to help in not only predicting and preventing the disasters but also to help in management during them.
For now we are planning to incorporate the following features. More can be added later and we'll tick them out as soon as they are finished. Our plan is to use the complete software development stack with the power of machine learning to help in better management and prevention of disasters.

---

- [ ] A unified platform that can be used for volunteers to register and come together
- [ ] A simple center to collect all kinds of helps (Donations, Money etc.)
- [ ] Tool to sync the resources and human help
- [ ] Use weather reports and past incidents to predict disasters in nearby areas using Machine Learning
- [ ] A platform where one can get reliable information and avoid hoaxes and rumours.
- [ ] (Use Machine Learning to classify and remove hoaxes and fake news)
- [ ] Using Reporting Systems to Notify people about disasters (both sides)
- [ ] Create action plans for deploying resources
- [ ] Do optimal resource allocation and distribution using Machine Learning that uses contextual information
- [ ] (Use Machine Learning for assessment of the disaster prone areas and use the information for better resource allocation)
 - [ ] A database of people and areas affected
 - [ ] Use crowdsourced data for disaster management
 - [ ] Using Macihne Learning to assess the situations for better resource deployment
 - [ ] Add more if possible

We know all these tasks will take a substantial amount of time and thus the promise of adding anything better may seem too far fetched but all good ideas require proper execution and better adaptation to situations. Thus we'll try to implement as many features as possible but implement them in a proper and useful way. Moreover as and if time requires addition or removal of any ideas, we will do the same because ideas cant be static :-)
