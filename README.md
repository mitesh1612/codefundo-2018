# Project Idea

Our idea is to create a unified platform to achieve various tasks in disaster management, prevention and recovery. 
We are planning to incorporate helpful mitigation features alongisde Machine Learning to help in not only predicting and preventing the disasters but also to help in management during them.
For now we are planning to incorporate the following features. More can be added later and we'll tick them out as soon as they are finished. Our plan is to use the complete software development stack with the power of machine learning to help in better management and prevention of disasters.

We are planning to create a unified platform that can be used by volunteers as well as by the people affected by the disaster. The advantages of our App are fourfolds:

- [ ] A simple center to collect all kinds of helps (Donations, Money etc.)
- [ ] Use weather reports and past incidents (using crowdsourced data) to predict disasters and warnings in nearby areas using Machine Learning.
- [ ] A platform where one can get reliable information and avoid hoaxes and rumours. Here will try to predict whehter the news is fake or not.
- [ ] Create action plans for deploying resources using optimal resource allocation and distribution with the help of Machine Learning that uses contextual information.

We know all these tasks will take a substantial amount of time and thus the promise of adding anything better may seem too far fetched but all good ideas require proper execution and better adaptation to situations. Thus we'll try to implement as many features as possible but implement them in a proper and useful way. Moreover as and if time requires addition or removal of any ideas, we will do the same because ideas can't be static :-)
